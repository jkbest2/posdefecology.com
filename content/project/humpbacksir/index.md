This project is a collaboration between Alex Zerbini, Grant Adams, and myself. 

# Purpose

The Southern Atlantic population of humpback whales (*Megaptera novaeangliae*) has been exploited since the late 1800s. The population reached particularly low levels in the mid-20th century, but has been recovering since the cessation of most harvest in (year?). We have updated code originally written by Alex Zerbini that fits a Bayesian population model using importance sampling (particularly the SIR algorithm).
